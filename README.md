Welcome to this non-exhaustive list of technologies and their approximate ages. I put it together as a slight dig at recruiters who expect you to have known a two year old language for five years.

If you would like to add a language, please add it to the array in `src/technologies.js`. All contributions are welcome, no matter how obscure the technology!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A big thanks to [all of the contributors](https://github.com/jsrn/howoldisit/graphs/contributors) for massively expanding this beyond the tiny handful of technologies I had listed to begin with.
